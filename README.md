# Dozen Bakery FOH Sales Analysis 2024  

## Overview  
This project analyzes front-of-house (FOH) sales data for Dozen Bakery in 2024. It provides insights into sales trends, key revenue drivers, discount patterns, and category performance. Additionally, it includes demand forecasting for egg orders and other bakery items to optimize staffing and preparation.  

This analysis is based on **real-world data** from my absolute favorite local bakery, **Dozen Bakery**â€”huge thanks to my friends there for their support!  

## Key Insights  
- **Total Gross Sales**: $2,224,306  
- **Monthly Sales Average**: $195,151, with a strong increase in the final quarter  
- **Top Revenue Driver**: Pastries consistently generate the highest sales  
- **Seasonal Trends**: A slight dip in sales from May to October, though not drastic  
- **Discounts**: $118,547 total (5.33% of gross sales), averaging $9,879 per month  
- **Growth Opportunity**: Savory retail underperforms compared to other categories  

## Data Breakdown  
- **Egg Orders**: Hourly analysis to improve staffing and preparation  
- **Bread & Pastries**: Top-performing types and peak order times  
- **Beverages & Lunch Items**: Popular choices and demand trends  
- **Retail & Savory Retail**: Best-selling products and opportunities for improvement  

## Forecasting  
A demand forecasting model was developed to predict egg order volumes for new hours, based on historical hourly sales. The model serves as a guide for optimizing operations but does not account for external market shifts.  

## Usage  
This analysis can help:  
- Improve staffing efficiency  
- Adjust inventory based on peak demand times  
- Identify areas for growth, particularly in savory retail  
- Optimize discount strategies to maintain profitability
